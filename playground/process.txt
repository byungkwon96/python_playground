Process: An instance of a program (e.g a Python interpreter, window browser)

+ Takes advantage of multiple CPUs and cores
+ Seperate memeory space -> Memory is not shared between processes
+ Great for CPU-bound processing
+ New process is started independently from other processes 
+ Processes are interruptable/killable
+ One GIL for each prosses -> avoids GIL(Global Interperter Lock) limitation

- Heavyweight
- Starting a process is slower than starting a thread
- More Memory
- IPC (inter-process communication) is more complicated
