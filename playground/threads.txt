Threads: An entity within a process that can be scheduled (also known as "light weight process")
A process can spawn multiple Threads

+ All threads within a process share the same Memory
+ lightweight
+ Starting a thread is faster than starting a process
+ Great for I/O-bound tasks (Input Output tasks)

- Threading is limited by GIL: Only one thread at a time
- No effect for CPU-bound tasks
- Not interruptable/killable
- Careful with race conditions
